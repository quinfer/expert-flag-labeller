# Expert Flag Labeler: Invitation to Research Project

Dear Colleague,

I'm pleased to invite you to participate in the Expert Flag Labeler project, a specialized web application for the expert classification of flags in Northern Ireland street-level imagery. Your expertise is invaluable to this academic research project, which aims to develop a comprehensive hierarchical classification system for cultural symbols across Northern Ireland.

## Project Background

The Expert Flag Labeler application addresses methodological challenges in cultural symbol classification through advanced image processing and expert labeling. Our dataset comprises approximately 60,000 flag images collected from 50 towns across Northern Ireland, with each image containing pre-identified potential flags.

Through stratified random sampling, we've selected a manageable subset of these images for expert classification. This sampling ensures balanced representation across:
- Geographical distribution (all towns)
- Varying detection complexity (single vs. multi-flag images)
- Different environmental contexts
- Various display types and conditions

### The Side-by-Side Viewing Solution

A significant advancement in our methodology is the implementation of side-by-side viewing. Each classification task presents both:
1. The cropped flag (left side) - For detailed flag examination
2. The original context (right side) - To understand the flag's placement and surroundings

This approach provides you with comprehensive visual information while maintaining a focused classification task.

## The Application Interface

The Expert Flag Labeler web application provides an intuitive interface for classification:

1. **Secure Authentication**: Log in with your personal credentials
2. **Side-by-Side Image Viewing**: Each task shows both the flag detail and its original context
3. **Comprehensive Classification Form**:
   - Primary category (National, Fraternal, Sport, Military, Historical, International, Proscribed)
   - Display context (building-mounted, parade, bunting, etc.)
   - Specific flag identification with subcategories
   - Confidence assessment on a 5-point scale
4. **Review Flagging**: Mark uncertain cases for additional expert review
5. **Progress Tracking**: Resume classification at any time with saved progress

## Accessing the Application

The application is now live at [https://expert-flag-labeler.vercel.app/](https://expert-flag-labeler.vercel.app/)

To log in:
- **Username**: Your first name
- **Password**: Provided separately for security

## Classification Guidelines

When classifying flags, please:

1. **Examine both views**: Look at both the cropped flag and its original context
2. **Select the primary category**: Choose the most appropriate academic category
3. **Identify the display context**: Note how the flag is presented (individual, bunting, mural, etc.)
4. **Provide specific identification**: Select the specific flag type where possible
5. **Indicate confidence**: Use the 1-5 scale to indicate your certainty
6. **Flag for review**: Use this option only for truly ambiguous cases

## Project Significance

Your expert classifications will contribute to:

1. Creating a validated dataset of Northern Ireland flag displays
2. Training machine learning models for automated flag classification
3. Supporting academic research on spatial and temporal patterns of cultural symbol displays
4. Developing a valuable resource for understanding symbolic landscapes

This research adheres to strict ethical guidelines, including anonymization of location data, careful handling of sensitive categories, and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Timeline and Support

We request that you complete your classifications within the next four weeks. The application saves your progress automatically, allowing you to work at your convenience.

For technical issues or questions about the classification protocol, please contact me directly at [contact email].

Thank you for your valuable contribution to this research project. Your expertise is essential to creating an accurate classification system for cultural symbols in Northern Ireland.

Sincerely,

Barry Quinn  
Project Lead, Expert Flag Labeler
